# cdk-stats

Welcome to CDK Stats! This is my side project that provides a dynamic .svg file that can be embedded into your GitHub profile.

The url to hit is: [https://cdk-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kaizencc](https://cdk-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kaizencc)

You should replace your GitHub username in the url to access your specific stats.

Then, you can add it to your personal GitHub README page. Just add the following line to a markdown file:

```
<img align="center" src="https://cdk-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kaizencc"/>
```

Now, your markdown file will dynamically render your personal stats, which will update every time you contribute to the
[aws-cdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk). Thanks for contributing to that open source project!

## Contributing

Please do! If you are a experienced in frontend and think you can render a better .svg file, I would looove your help.
If you have a feature request or good idea please cut a GitHub issue and I will do my best :).
